I carved out some time on Sunday to take a deeper look at your product and better understand what your team is looking for. After speaking with Ian, I wanted to explore a few ideas and get a clearer sense of how your system operates, so I put together a quick prototype to illustrate my initial thinking.

I also did not have prior experience with ATAK, so I spent time researching how its services could be integrated. The code I wrote is only a stub at this stage, but it reflects my understanding of how the system functions and how I would begin approaching an integration.

There were a few areas where I had to make assumptions, particularly around how your chat feature handles message and location payloads. My assumption is that the system keeps messages extremely lightweight for reliability across nodes or global hotspots, which would explain the absence of audio support. I time‑boxed the prototype to a single day and encountered some limitations on an older Samsung tablet, but the intent and direction should still be clear.

At Microsoft, audio capture and transcription are deeply integrated into chat and channel experiences—an area where I’ve spent significant time—so I wanted to contrast that complexity with a simpler approach here. This prototype is not production‑ready, but it reflects how I would begin thinking about the problem space. I may refine it further this week, depending on my schedule.

I also spent time reviewing the “Our Culture” section on your website, and much of it resonated with me. I’m drawn to work that is challenging, meaningful, and technically demanding, and your team’s mission aligns strongly with that. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute.

If you believe I may be a good fit, please feel free to reach out to Ian and I would be glad to continue the conversation.

.....and in case you think I type really fast I'll share with you that AI writes all my Kdocs. Its my favorite feature beyond Agentic and Gen AI. It's the little things that I love :)

Timebox exceeded...my wife just told me to "send what you got, and call it for the day"
